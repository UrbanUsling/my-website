Making a Python fullstack webshop with flask and react.

Starting with backend with Python and a database (MySql preferably).

I will then add on simple frontend that I can upgrade to React and try to be as creative as I can with fixtures, components etc.

Next step would be addign stripe for payment and get comfortable with that.

Finally it will be functionality. Improving it all with docker and/or minikube and perhaps changing react to preact.
